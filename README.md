# Bizarro_ETH_Treasury


Treasury bonds show a negative correlation with Ethereum returns.

It appears that the 2-year and 10-year bond yields have p-values below 0.05, indicating statistical significance, whereas the 1-year bond yield has a p-value above 0.05. However, the R-squared value is quite low, suggesting that while US Treasury bond yields may have some correlation with ETH returns, they alone cannot effectively explain the variation in ETH returns. Further research is required.
